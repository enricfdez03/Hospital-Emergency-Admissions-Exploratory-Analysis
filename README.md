# Hospital-Emergency-Admissions-Exploratory-Analysis
Warwick Uni - Programming for Business Application: 78% (First Class Honours). 
Introductory programming project using Python applied to a real business dataset. The dataset contained hourly admissions to a London hospitalâ€™s Accident & Emergency unit, categorized by reason and type. The goal was to create three visualizations to support management decisions. In my case, these focused on proposing better resource allocation and workforce planning.
