# Hospital-Emergency-Admissions-Exploratory-Analysis
Warwick Uni - Programming for Business Application: 78% (First Class Honours). Introductory programming project using Python applied to a real business dataset. The dataset contained hourly admissions to a London hospital’s Accident & Emergency unit, categorized by reason and type. The goal was to create three visualizations to support management decisions — in my case, focused on proposing better resource allocation and workforce planning.
